 I've just got a new version of visual studio installed so just working through some teething issues to get everything working.

IMHO-in my humble opinion



Always happy to help

I’ve only been working directly with you for the past 3 months but already had heard many good things from Chris and Ian F in advance of that, you’re knowledge of IDaaS is quite unique, from your time on the support team working with Chris and Ann to diagnose and resolve issues in the more unusual areas gives you a unique perspective on issues. Over the past quarter though I’ve been working much more closely with you and I’ve been able to see your great attitude and skills first hand, you’ve always been willing to step up for anything that needs doing and you’ve stepped into the team smoothly despite having to also learn dotnet core at the same time. On that note, your technical skills have been shown over the past quarter, producing great quality work helping to get the unit test coverage up above 90% and ensuring no errors or warning in our code which helps us to be in a stronger position going forward, on top of this you are great at coming back with not only concerns and issues but solutions to them as well.

Regarding improvements, I’d like to see you more involved in our meetings, as mentioned your knowledge of IDaaS is great, and you ability to identify solutions to problems is proven, so I’d like to hear more of your thoughts in meetings we have.

Overall, You’ve made a great impression on many of the people you’ve worked with and I look forward to working with you more in the future
